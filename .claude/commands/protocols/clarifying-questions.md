# Clarifying Questions Workflow

Used by generate-prd.md to gather requirements systematically.

## Initial Type Determination

"Is this a specification for:
a) A new product/system from scratch (core product)  
b) A new feature for an existing product (feature addition)"

## Common Questions for Both Types

### Problem & Goals

- "What problem does this feature solve for the user?"
- "What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?"

### User Context  

- "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
- "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform?"

### Stories & Criteria

- "Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit].)"
- "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?"

### Scope & Boundaries

- "Are there any specific things this feature *should not* do (non-goals)?"
- "What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?"

### Design & Implementation

- "Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?"
- "Can you describe the desired look and feel?"
- "Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?"

## Question Format

Provide options in letter/number lists for easy selection when possible.
